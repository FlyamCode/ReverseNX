# ReverseNX
SaltyNX plugin forcing docked or handheld graphics settings

For now in experimental phase, because it looks like SaltyNX is not in good terms with some games (they will crash without any plugin).

Flags:
create in folder `saltynx/plugins/ReverseNX/` empty file:
- `docked.flag` for docked mode
or
- `handheld.flag` for handheld mode 

When both flags are there or none of them, plugin will ignore loading.
