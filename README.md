# ReverseNX
SaltyNX plugin forcing docked or handheld graphics settings

For now in experimental phase, because it looks like SaltyNX is not in good terms with some games (they will crash without any plugin).

Flags:
create in folder `saltynx\plugins\ReverseNX\` empty file:
- `docked.flag` for docked mode
- `handheld.flag` for handheld mode 

Confirmed games working:
- Crash Team Racing
- God Eater 3
- Kirby Star Allies
- Mages of Mystralia
- Super Mario Maker 2
- The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
- This is the Police
- Yooka-Yaylee

Confirmed games Crashing:
- Octopath Traveler
- American Fugitive
