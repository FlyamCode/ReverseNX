# ReverseNX
SaltyNX plugin forcing docked or handheld graphics settings

For now in experimental phase, because it looks like SaltyNX is not in good terms with some games (they will crash without any plugin).

Confirmed games working:
- God Eater 3
- This is the Police

Confirmed games Crashing:
- Octopath Traveler
- American Fugitive
